1. ThermoWood Fundamentals
Thermal Process: ThermoWood is natural wood treated with heat and steam above ~160 °C. The ITWA handbook emphasizes that only heat/steam are used (no chemical additives) and that the changes are permanent. The process drives moisture content very low (~4-7%) and alters cell structure, improving durability and stability. For example, birch boards might shrink from 25x125 mm to ~24x121 mm after treatment. These exact shrinkages vary by species, but always plan for a few percent smaller cross-sections.
Moisture & Stability: Post-treatment, ThermoWood absorbs far less water. Peer-reviewed studies show significantly reduced water uptake and swelling compared to untreated wood. In short, you get straighter, more stable boards under humidity swings. LDCwood notes Thermo-D (modified) panels "stay drier" with enhanced decay and insect resistance. Use this benefit: send the right message that a Thermo panel will maintain its dimensions much better than raw cedar or pine.
Mechanical Trade-Offs: The flip side is strength. Thermal modification typically reduces bending strength and sometimes stiffness, depending on the process severity. In practice, this means ThermoWood is usually classified as non-structural or at most no-higher-than-appearance-grade. Always clarify to builders that ThermoWood is still real wood and should be engineered as wood (no unsupported spans beyond design values). In siding and decking applications, the slight strength loss is usually acceptable and outweighed by longevity. But avoid overselling it as structural lumber substitute.

2. Fire Performance & Code Pathways
Untreated vs. Treated: Plain ThermoWood is still combustible. By itself, it does not meet Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) ignition-resistant standards. The key is SaferWood's Thermex-FR treatment on LDCwood's Ayous/Nordic Pine ThermoWood. According to BPWood, this product achieved Class A on ASTM E2768 after ASTM D2898 conditioning.
- ASTM E2768: A 30-minute "tunnel" (Steiner) test that extends E84 to wildfire-level duration.
- ASTM D2898: Accelerated weathering ("800-inch rain" with UV cycles) for exterior fire-retardant wood. Passing E2768 after D2898 is the standard for Exterior Fire-Retardant-Treated Wood (FRTW).
Code Requirements: The IBC and IWUIC require an extended test. IBC §2303.2 defines FRTW by flame spread index (FSI) <=25 (Class A). However, for exterior use in fire zones (IWUIC/IBC WUI chapter 7A), the wood must also pass weathering. BPWood's reference says: it's recognized as Ignition-Resistant Exterior FRTW under both IBC and IWUIC. In practice, that means:
- Documented Testing: You must see lab reports. Ask for an ICC-ESR or UL report (e.g. SaferWood ICC-ESR-1159) that explicitly covers exterior use under IWUIC conditions.
- Performance Criteria: Verify "Class A after D2898" is claimed. The SaferWood bulletin and ESR confirm that ThermoWood treated meets IWUIC 503.2.3 (Item 3) for ignition-resistant wood. Without D2898 weathering, a material is only interior-rated (10-min Class A).
Specifier Checklist:
- Lab Reports: Obtain the full evaluation (e.g. ICC-ESR-1159 with IWUIC supplement).
- Markings: Verify any wood marking or documentation says "Exterior Fire-Retardant Treated (FRTW)" and cites standards.
- Treatment Process: Ensure product is kiln-dried after FR treatment (KDAT).
- Realistic Claims: If they only mention "Class A flame spread" without weathering, that's incomplete. For true WUI compliance, insist on the 30-min post-weathering numbers.

3. Installation & Handling
ThermoWood behaves like high-performance wood siding, not drywall. Key points:
- Acclimatization: Store boards in the building environment until they reach equilibrium moisture (~4-7%). LDCwood's guide explicitly instructs this. Do not install when the wood is still above spec moisture.
- Ventilated Rainscreen: Always install with a continuous air gap and drainage plane behind the boards. This is critical: even though ThermoWood takes up less water, any moisture that penetrates must evaporate. The installation diagram in LDCwood's manual shows a full break with a ventilated cavity.
- Fasteners: Use stainless-steel nails/screws. LDCwood advises stainless for corrosion resistance. For hidden clips, pick a system that allows end grain movement. Pre-drilling is often recommended due to reduced strength and higher density of some ThermoSpecies.
- Finish and Appearance: ThermoWood can be left to weather naturally (silver gray) or stained/coated. Inform clients that even ThermoWood needs UV maintenance if a color is desired. Unsealed wood will gray; sealed wood needs periodic re-finishing (like cedar).
- Cut Ends & Caulking: Always treat cut ends and perforations with a compatible finish or sealant. Even though resin content is low, end grains are porous. LDCwood's brochure reminds installers: "Seal all cut ends on site" and "treat cut surfaces".
- Storage: Protect stock from rain. LDCwood warns that ThermoWood left wet in a stack will absorb moisture and lose dimensional benefits.
Common Failures to Avoid: Neglecting rainscreen (e.g. closing gap with cement board backing) will trap moisture. Using carbon steel fasteners will cause rust bleed. Assuming ThermoWood doesn't warp is wrong - it stabilizes but still moves with humidity. Use this knowledge to create a clear install spec in every bid.

4. Market & Supply-Chain Intelligence
Partnership Status: BPWood (Penticton, BC) is now LDCwood's exclusive North American arm. A 2022 deal gave BPWood Canadian distribution rights, and a Feb 2026 LOI confirms BPWood taking equity in LDCwood. This means BPWood-LDCwood product development is co-ordinated: expect new products (like the ThermeX-FR ThermoWood) to roll out exclusively through BPWood.
Product Lineup & SKUs: The core species are Thermo-Ayous (Afrormosia) and Thermo-Nordic Pine, both Class 1 (timber use) in exterior. Secondary lines include Fraké, Ash, etc. Each species comes in several profiles (flat panels, tongue-groove cladding, deck boards, soffit planks, etc.). For example, the BPWood "Patterns" PDF lists LDC profile codes like LDC ALTA, LDC DANA, LDC TABY with dimensions (e.g. 20x118 mm T&G).

5. Objection Handlers & Battlecards
Objection 1: "Wood burns. I can't use this in a fire zone/commercial build."
Rebuttal: "Untreated wood does burn, but our ThermoWood is pressure-treated with Thermex-FR. It doesn't just pass standard fire tests; it passes ASTM E2768 (30-minute Class A) after going through ASTM D2898 accelerated weathering. This means it is certified as 'Exterior Ignition-Resistant' for Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) zones. I can send you the ICC evaluation report to show your building inspector right now."

Objection 2: "It's wood. It's going to warp and check like Cedar eventually."
Rebuttal: "Because of the thermal modification at 160°C, the moisture content is locked at 4-7%. It absorbs almost no water. It actually expands and contracts about half as much as cedar. As long as your crew leaves a standard 20mm rainscreen gap for ventilation, it will stay straight and vastly outperform cedar over its lifetime."

Objection 3: "It's too expensive compared to standard pine or cedar."
Rebuttal: "It is a premium upfront, but you are buying decades of life, Class A fire compliance, and a massive reduction in maintenance. For architects and contractors, it eliminates the cost of callbacks for warped or rotting boards. Plus, it has EN 350 Class 1 durability-giving it the exact same rot resistance as premium Western Red Cedar, but with better stability."

Competitors (Lunawood & Thermory / TimberBase):
- The Fire Code Advantage: Lunawood and Thermory tout durability and "no chemicals," but they lack North American code-approved fire ratings for wildfire zones. BPWood has the hard data (ICC-ESR-1159) to prove exterior fire compliance.
- The Supply Chain Advantage: BPWood isn't just a reseller; we have an exclusive North American partnership (and a future equity stake) in LDCwood (Belgium). This means priority production and local US/Canada stock.
